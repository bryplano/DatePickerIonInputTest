This is a sample Ionic 4.3.0 application that demos using the @ionic-native/datepicker wrapper and cordova-plugin-datepicker within the confines of an @ionic/angular 4.X app.

To run this application:

- Download the repository or clone to your local machine
- In Terminal, switch to the project directory
- Run `npm i` and `ionic cordova platform add ios`
- Run the application on a connected device or emulator using `ionic cordova run ios`

You can see the issue in the following screenshots:
